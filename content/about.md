<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

----
I'm a husband, father and all around geek.  I wanted a place to write about my adventures in programming and software development.  You're reading the results.

Not much else is really newsworthy.  I live in a small town in Minnesota, work 40 hours a week, and go to church on Sunday.  I play drums, bass, sing mostly on key, and even occasionally write something.

I can cook well enough I suppose.  Not all that handy with the tools, but I still have all my appendages so that's got to count for something.

Mostly I just enjoy learning about stuff.  My head is so full of useless knowledge that it's suprising I can put my pants on in the morning sometimes.  But at least with this blog I have a way of writing about the things I'm learning.  That's pretty cool.
