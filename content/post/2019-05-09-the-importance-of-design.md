One of the things I'd been able to skate by on up until recently was not having to do much planning before I started writing code.  I'd just write as I went along.  Usually it worked out for me.  After all, I wasn't really designing anything new, instead I was expanding existing systems that were already in place.  Even in cases where this wasn't **\*quite\*** true (blenderseed's OSL shading interface was a new design), my preferred method of working still got results because the total size of the new feature was pretty small compared to the overall project.  Hell, I was even winging it during the **"blenderseed re-write of 2018"** (for proper effect, say that with a booming, echoing voice).

Here's where I should say something about the comfort of routine, but that would be <acronym title="Avoid at all costs">mansplaining</acronym>, and...

So anyhoo.

1. Jon's Coding Workflow:
   1. Make it up as you go.  
   2. Backtrack and fix older stuff that doesn't work because of changes.
   3. Make too many updates in a row to older code to account for new features.
   4. Let your shogun approach cause plenty of bugs.
   5. Get confused because you can't remember how you got to where you are, you just know something isn't working.
   6. Fix bugs?
   7.  .....
   8. Profit!
   9. Fix more bugs in a random, undisciplined fashion.
   10. Re-write the whole damn thing because you've jacked it up so bad (and didn't document any of it).
   11. S*#$@, now nothing works.
   12. Cry salty tears of bitter defeat.
   13. Go to bed.
