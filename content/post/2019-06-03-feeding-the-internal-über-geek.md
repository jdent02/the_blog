All So somewhere along the lines I had heard of something called the 'Humble Bundle'.  hadn't really paid too much attention to it and really had no idea what it was other than some kind of package of stuff that was sold for an insanely low price.  Then one of the guys on the appleseed Discord server posted a link:

THE HUMBLE BOOK BUNDLE: COMPUTER GRAPHICS

Oh boy, if food is the way to a man's heart, this is the way straight to his inner nerd...Or is it inner geek?  I can't keep the two straight.  When I was a kid both were insults, now at least one is supposedly a badge of honor.

There is SOOOO MUCH stuff in this bundle.  Books on OpenGL, realistic rendering, character rig design, realtime shadows, volumetric rendering, renderer design, hell there's even a book on how to implement multithreading.

All kidding aside, that's a lot of stuff, and it's way more than I could conceivably read in anything less than a few years.  So what do I prioritize?  Well, for RIFT's purpose there are three books of interest:

* Raytracing from the Ground Up - I think this will be a great addition to the Pete Shirley books that formed the base of RIFT.  Hell, Shirley is name dropped several times in the first section.  I can already see that this authors approach is different from Shirley's, so it'll be interesting to see what I need to do to integrate anything from this book into RIFT.
* Multithreading for Visual Effects - Multithreading is pretty much a requirement for effective rendering these days, especially with path tracing engines.  I'm currently browsing the section on Houdini to see how they did it.  There's a lot of good material, but it's really in depth so parts are flying straight over my head.  Plus I'm not a huge fan of how much Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is being hawked by the authors.  Sure it helps to point out the types of libraries developers might need to use, but it runs dangerously close to advertising here.
* 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development - This is pure reference material.  For the most part I understand the concepts behind the terms and math used in path tracers, but the gritty details on WHY still eludes me.  I'm hoping this massive tome will help with that.  Seriously, this behemoth is 850 pages long.  That's like a college textbook (actually, I think this is a college textbook).

So that's three books out of the nineteen (!!) in the bundle.  Will I read the other books?  Yeah, probably at some point (I'm curious about the volume rendering and OpenGL books).  But the three above seem the most relevant to RIFT (and that's why I bought the bundle in the first place).

Now let's hope I can get through those three before the zombie apocalypse hits.
