All So somewhere along the lines I had heard of something called the 'Humble Bundle'.  hadn't really paid too much attention to it and really had no idea what it was other than some kind of package of stuff that was sold for an insanely low price.  Then one of the guys on the appleseed Discord server posted a link:

THE HUMBLE BOOK BUNDLE: COMPUTER GRAPHICS

Oh boy, if food is the way to a man's heart, this is the way straight to his inner nerd...Or is it inner geek?  I can't keep the two straight.  When I was a kid both were insults, now at least one is supposedly a badge of honor.

There is SOOOO MUCH stuff in this bundle.  Books on OpenGL, relaistic rendering, character rig design, realtime shadows, volumetric rendering, renderer design, hell there's even a book on how to implement multithreading.

All kidding aside (not really) that's a lot of stuff, and it's way more than I could conceivably read in anything less than a few years.  So what do I prioritize?
