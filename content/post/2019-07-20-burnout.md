Well, it was bound to happen, given how much time I spent thinking about RIFT and nothing else: burnout.  It's real, and part of it sucks, but the other part is actually kind of relieving.

It was bound to happen given how much time I was spending not only on RIFT, but also the appleseed plugin for Blender.  Now that I think about it, I figure I'd probably spent several hundred hours since the beginning of the year coding, researching and testing.  That's a lot (especially when it was mostly in my free time).  Everything was humming along, and then I pretty much hit a brick wall and lost all interest in working on RIFT.  I think my main goal of getting RIFT Next up and running is what was driving me, and now that this has been accomplished, I don't have any solid goals.

The same thing happened with blenderseed at about the same time.  With the 2.8 release of Blender imminent, I've stopped adding new features to the exporter for the time being.  So far I haven't seen any major bugs, so I don't have any pressing goals there either.

So now what?

I take a break, that's what.
