"Oh Great!" you're thinking, "another blog from another guy who works with rendering engines.  **What could he possibly bring to the table?**"

Good question... There are a lot of blogs out there from guys that work on some pretty hard core rendering engines:

Matt Pharr: <https://pharr.org/matt/blog/>

Mike Farnsworth: <http://renderspud.blogspot.com/>

Yining Lee: <https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/>

All of these guys are really, really good at what they do.

Compared to them, I am but a little grasshopper.  Like really little...
