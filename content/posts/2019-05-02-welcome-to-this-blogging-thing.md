# "Oh Great!"

you're thinking, "another blog from another guy who works with rendering engines.  **What could he possibly bring to the table?**"

Good question... There are a lot of blogs out there from guys that work on some pretty hard core rendering engines:

[Matt Pharr](https://pharr.org/matt/blog/)

[Mike Farnsworth](http://renderspud.blogspot.com/)

[Yining Lee](https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/)

All of these guys are really, really good at what they do.

Compared to them, I am but a little grasshopper.  Like really little...

![Really, really little](/images/621734c5d09782244238867c08a97016.png "Really, really little")

I'm only a few years into this coding thing, working almost entirely in my free time (to the occasional annoyance of my ever loving wife).  I'm less than a year into learning C++.

But in that time, I've worked with some really smart people on some great projects:

[PRMan for Blender](https://github.com/prman-pixar/RenderManForBlender)

[appleseed](https://github.com/appleseedhq)

And I decided I wanted to write a rendering engine of my own.

So isn't that a bit of a unique spin on the usual blog?  I'm learning not only how these render engines work, but also how to write the code that powers them.

# So?

So I want this blog to be written for the people like me: neophytes to this wonderful world of rendering.  Neophytes to the C++ language.  Neophytes to the challenges of working with Digital Content Creation programs (DCC) like [Blender](www.blender.org) and their powerful yet often frustrating API's (and the tricks around some of it).  If you've read this far, I hope you enjoy what you read.
